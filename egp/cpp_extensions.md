# Built-in C++ extension workflow

EGP includes a pinned godot-cpp SDK in the editor executable. Extension authors
do not need to download godot-cpp, generate bindings, or install Python/SCons.
The native compiler and CMake 3.20 or later are required. On Windows, use Visual
Studio with the C++ desktop workload; CMake selects the installed Visual Studio
toolchain automatically. Linux and macOS use the host CMake/compiler toolchain.
Windows is the initial validation platform.

## In the editor

1. Open **Project → Project Settings → GDExtensions**.
   Select **Check Toolchain** to verify CMake, C++17 compilation, and linking.
   Select **Install Tools** if dependencies are missing; installer output appears
   in the panel. Complete any operating-system installation/admin prompts.
2. Enter a lowercase C++ identifier, such as `movement`, and select **Create Extension**.
3. Edit `res://extensions/movement/src/extension.cpp`. The sample registers
   `EGP_movement_Node` with a callable `get_message()` method.
4. Select **Build Debug**. The first build compiles the bundled bindings; later
   extensions reuse the SDK library cache across projects.
5. Compiler diagnostics link to the source line in the editor's text editor.
6. A successful build loads or reloads the extension. If loading needs a restart,
   use **Save Scenes and Restart Editor**. Build failures retain the previously
   published descriptor and library.
7. Select **Build Release** before a release export. Standard GDExtension export
   handling includes the library selected by the project's export features.

The CMake executable defaults to `cmake` on PATH and can be changed in the panel.
The editor also detects the standard Windows CMake installation, the macOS CMake
app, and Homebrew's Apple Silicon installation. Windows setup uses WinGet and
reuses an existing Visual Studio C++ workload. Linux setup supports apt, dnf,
pacman, and zypper through polkit. macOS requests Apple's Command Line Tools and
uses an existing Homebrew installation for CMake, or opens its official installer.
Running-game Debug rebuilds require opting in to runtime reload before launch;
see [the reload contract](api_contract.md#runtime-reload). Stop the game before
Release rebuilds. Extension source files and CMake settings
belong in source control; generated `bin/` files and editor caches do not.
The descriptor is created after the first successful build. Hashed library copies
avoid overwriting a DLL already loaded by the editor. Older copies may be removed
after closing the editor; keep the copies referenced by the descriptor.

## Engine maintainers

Initialize the pinned dependency before building EGP:

```sh
git submodule update --init --depth 1
```

To build bindings for the exact engine API, including fork-specific classes, use:

```sh
python misc/scripts/build_egp_cpp_editor.py -- platform=windows -j4
```

Pass normal SCons flags after `--` (for example `module_mono_enabled=yes`). This
builds a bootstrap editor, dumps its API, then embeds matching bindings in the
final editor. Packaged C++ CI editors use this path. It is an engine-maintainer
step; extension authors need neither Python nor binding generation.

Direct SCons editor builds automatically generate and embed the default SDK. Export templates
do not include the editor SDK or its UI. The default bindings target the bundled
Godot 4.7 API snapshot, which is supported by the 4.8 engine baseline. To expose
new or fork-specific APIs, dump `extension_api.json` from the intended EGP binary
and rebuild the editor with `egp_cpp_api=<absolute path to the JSON>`. Retain an
API snapshot as a release-build input when publishing the corresponding editor.
Bindings match the engine build's pointer size and real-number precision. The
workflow initially builds for the local editor platform/architecture, rather
than configuring cross-compilation toolchains.

The SDK is extracted into the editor's cache directory under `egp_cpp/sdk`.
Short paths avoid Windows compiler path limits. Build caches are separate for
each project/extension; library caches are shared by SDK, compiler, platform,
architecture, and Debug/Release configuration. Extension projects remain ordinary
shared-library GDExtensions; changing an extension does not require rebuilding EGP.

Hot reload preserves existing extension objects when the native base remains
compatible. Changing method arguments or return types invalidates cached native
method bindings and prints a diagnostic; dynamic method lookup and ordinary
`Callable` lookup use the new signature. Update callers to match the signature.
Code holding raw cached method bindings needs a restart.

Changing a class's native base requires a restart. Removing a class, or rejecting
its base change, retains the registration record for compatible repair, including
in an editor without live instances. Existing objects remain as their original
native parent and retains their saved extension properties. The reload result is
`LOAD_STATUS_NEEDS_RESTART`. Restore the compatible class and reload to recover
its state, or restart to apply the new hierarchy. Parent properties can still be
edited during recovery. This does not guarantee recovery for arbitrary binary
layout, inheritance, or binding changes.

## Command line

The editor executable provides the same workflow without a project script:

```sh
EGP --headless --editor --path /path/to/project -- --cpp-check
EGP --headless --editor --path /path/to/project -- --cpp-install
EGP --headless --editor --path /path/to/project -- --cpp-create=movement --cpp-build=movement:debug
EGP --headless --editor --path /path/to/project -- --cpp-build=movement:release
```

Use `--cpp-cmake=/absolute/path/to/cmake` before a command to override discovery.
Use `--cpp-help` for usage. Commands run in order, stream output, and exit with 0
on success or 1 on failure. The project must contain `project.godot`. Builds wait
for the editor's file scan before advancing or exiting. Install commands can
require administrator approval; headless CI should provision tools in advance.

## Validation

`misc/scripts/egp_cpp_editor_smoke.gd` runs the actual editor panel in a disposable
project. It checks scaffolding, compilation, shared SDK reuse by a second extension,
custom-node registration, a deliberate compile failure with descriptor preservation,
source-line navigation, saving edited source, rebuilding/reloading changed code,
and debug/release library mappings. Run it with a locally built EGP editor:

```sh
EGP --headless --editor --path <disposable project> --script <absolute path to egp_cpp_editor_smoke.gd>
```

The test expects a new project without an existing `extensions/smoke` directory.
Windows x64 panel validation passed with MSVC and CMake. The older editor-script
harness reports RID/Object cleanup warnings at exit, so that harness does not
establish leak-free teardown.

The built-in CLI was separately verified with bindings generated from the
editor's actual 4.8 API. Installation detected the existing tools and verified
compilation/linking; creation, Debug/Release builds, and four failure exit-code
cases passed. A separately built Debug export template produced a game that
loaded the extension and verified its C++ method. The positive CLI, export, and
game checks completed without engine errors. The standalone validation editor
disabled Mono, D3D12, and AccessKit; the Debug template included Mono. This does
not establish full feature parity or performance qualification.

`misc/scripts/validate_egp_cpp.py` checks the built-in CLI, error exit codes, and
actual Debug/Release exports using separately built templates. The
`EGP C++ editor and exports` workflow runs it on Windows x64, Linux x64, and
macOS ARM64 and retains logs and timings. Its headless validation builds disable
rendering backends, Mono, and AccessKit. Workflow results qualify the tested
architecture and features only; adding a workflow does not establish a passing
result. Release-template exports and Linux/macOS parity remain pending current
workflow results. Positive checks reject unexpected engine errors as well as
incorrect exit codes or missing expected output.
