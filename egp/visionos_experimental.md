# Experimental immersive visionOS with Forward+

This opt-in prototype keeps EGP Forward+-only. It does not restore the Mobile
renderer. Physical Apple Vision Pro rendering, tracking, comfort, performance,
thermal behavior and lifecycle have not been qualified.

## What changed

Immersive startup is allowed only with `xr/visionos/experimental_forward_plus=true`,
Metal and the visionOS XR module. Startup enables XR shader variants before the
renderer is created, and rejects an explicit `--xr-mode off`.

The Compositor Services layer uses an unfoveated, layered RGBA16F color target and
D32Float+Stencil8 depth. Forward+ renders its ordinary stereo intermediate color
and tone maps into the external color texture; the external depth target is used
for depth rendering. Foveation remains disabled because Forward+'s compute and
screen-space passes do not implement Apple's logical-to-physical coordinate maps.

Texture imports are cached by native texture identity until XR shutdown. This
keeps earlier swapchain images valid for cached render bindings. The cache is
bounded to 32 color and 32 depth imports; it refuses further images instead of
accumulating unbounded imports. Restart the session if repeated resizing reaches
that limit. Dynamic render-quality changes are not qualified.

The first prototype requires HDR 2D, 3D render scale 1.0, and disabled MSAA and
temporal AA/upscaling. The renderer rejects incompatible buffers. Start with a
simple opaque scene and no post-processing. Mixed/progressive immersion, capture,
hand/controller interaction and pause/resume remain device follow-up work.

The initial Xcode launch profile sets `GODOT_MTL_SYNC_MODE=none`, selecting Metal's
native hazard tracking. The hosted Apple paravirtual GPU passed the stereo test
in this mode; the default manual-barrier path stalled waiting for a GPU fence.
That failure is retained in the earlier CI evidence. This does not establish
whether the default path works on a physical Vision Pro. Launch from the provided
Xcode scheme for the first device test; home-screen launches without that
environment and the manual-barrier path remain unqualified.

## Reproduce the automated stereo test

Use an editor built from the same commit as this source:

```sh
python3 misc/scripts/validate_visionos_forward_plus.py \
  --engine bin/godot.linuxbsd.editor.x86_64 --driver vulkan \
  --output .build/visionos-experimental
```

The fixture renders an asymmetric view of a box into two external RGBA16F/D32S8
texture layers, rotating through three texture pairs to mimic a swapchain. It
reads back color and sampled reverse-Z depth, checks both eyes
have visible geometry and different horizontal centroids, changes target size,
and repeats. It retains PNGs, numeric measurements, the binary hash and the full
log. Any engine/script error, timeout or missing success marker fails the test.
The Windows runner keeps the window hidden/offscreen, capped at 60 FPS with a
55-second watchdog. Linux CI uses Xvfb and Mesa's software Vulkan driver.

The `Experimental visionOS Forward+` workflow builds and packages a debug device template and two
editors from the candidate commit. Linux runs the stereo test. macOS records GPU
and architecture capabilities and only runs the Metal test when the hosted
runner can execute the arm64 Metal editor. A `NOT_RUN.txt` artifact means runtime
validation was unavailable, not passed. A final macOS job imports and exports the
sample using those same build artifacts, then runs `xcodebuild` for a generic
visionOS device with signing disabled. It checks the linked arm64 executable,
exported project pack, and Full immersive scene manifest. The handoff artifact
contains the generated Xcode project, unsigned app, logs and hashed receipt.
Neither fixture exercises Apple Compositor Services, foveation, ARKit or a headset.

For an export-only correction, a manual run may set `source_run_id` to reuse
previously successful native builds. The workflow verifies the source run and
rejects native source or build-option changes. It permits validation tooling,
documentation and the sample's required ETC2/ASTC import setting, and reruns the
Metal fixture before attempting the device app export.
Its `build-reuse.json` identifies both source commits. Ordinary pushes still
perform all builds. The sample enables ETC2/ASTC imports as required by the
visionOS exporter.

## Hand off to a device owner

1. Download `visionos-experimental-handoff` from a successful workflow run. Open
   `EGPProbe.xcodeproj` in the `xcode-project` directory, select your development
   team and signing identity, and select your Vision Pro. The unsigned app is
   retained as build evidence; it cannot be installed without signing. The
   project has no development team preconfigured. Keep the shared scheme's
   `GODOT_MTL_SYNC_MODE=none` launch environment enabled.
   Alternatively, build or download the matching macOS editor from the
   `visionos-experimental-editor` artifact to export it yourself.
   Download `godot_visionos.zip` from the workflow's device artifact. It contains
   the debug device template; release and simulator builds are not included.
   This is not a signed, installable app.
2. For a fresh export, open `misc/egp/visionos_forward_plus/project.godot`. Export using the visionOS
   preset with application role **Immersive (experimental)**, initially **Full**
   immersion. Set **Custom Template > Debug** to the downloaded ZIP. Set your
   own **App Store Team ID** and bundle identifier in the export preset before
   exporting (the exporter requires a team even for project-only exports).
   **Export Project Only** is enabled in this preset. Open the generated Xcode
   project and configure your signing identity and device there.
   For your own export, add `GODOT_MTL_SYNC_MODE=none` to the scheme's Run action
   environment variables, matching the provided handoff project.
3. Run without `--mock-xr`. The project initializes the real visionOS interface.
   Keep the supplied HDR, scale and AA settings. Read the startup warning and
   periodic `EGP_VISIONOS_DEVICE_OBSERVATION` messages; those are liveness signals,
   not successful rendering or performance measurements.
4. Verify each eye sees the box at the same perceived position and depth, then
   move the head and confirm tracking. Capture Xcode/Metal validation errors and
   frame timings. Check background/foreground, recenter, shutdown and reopening.
5. Test mixed and progressive immersion separately, including clear alpha and
   occlusion. Test hands/controllers separately before claiming input support.
6. Report engine commit, Xcode/visionOS/device versions, mode, settings, errors,
   screenshots/capture and a Metal System Trace. Keep `device_validated=false`
   until real evidence justifies changing the qualification status.

Foveation, MSAA, temporal effects, long-session resource behavior and repeated
quality/resize transitions need further implementation or device qualification.
