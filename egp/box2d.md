# EGP Box2D integration

Box2D is EGP's sole native 2D physics backend. Godot Physics 2D sources,
registration, editor build choices and obsolete solver settings are removed.
PhysicsServer2D and ordinary physics scene nodes remain the public integration
surface. The engine migrates old backend selections to `Box2D Physics` at startup.
Enabled physics requires the corresponding Box module; a missing module fails
the build rather than registering a dummy backend.

## Source and deterministic profile

- Solver: [erincatto/box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d), pinned unchanged
  at `56edae79f2949d86142b03450d5d60f63bcf5a6f` (3.2 development).
- Adapter origin: [erincatto/godot-box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/godot-box2d),
  `66260bc0eb77a9e6eb78b80cc163ed2c912b448b`, MIT, Andrew Song. EGP's modified
  native port uses engine RID registries and avoids GDExtension and godot-cpp.
- C17 solver, single precision, x86_64/arm64 desktop builds. Four-wide SIMD;
  precise arithmetic and disabled FMA contraction under Clang/GCC.
- Main-thread physics entry, process guard, fixed engine tick rate and four
  substeps by default. Time scaling and runtime tick-rate changes are rejected.
- `physics/box_2d/worker_count` defaults to 1, accepts 1–8, and is independent of
  hardware CPU count. `physics/box_2d/substeps` accepts 1–16. Both require restart.
- `physics/box_2d/pixels_per_meter` defaults to 100 and must be positive. The
  solver works directly in pixels with its tolerances scaled at initialization.
- Space traversal, shared-shape updates and callback delivery use RID order.
  Area overlaps retain RID/index records so shape-vector changes and callback
  deletion do not leave pointers to freed geometry.
- Custom integrators disable automatic gravity, damping and applied forces while
  retaining impulses and collision response. Direct-state environment getters
  retain the combined, gravity-scaled area values for application integration.

Determinism also depends on application creation order, identical geometry,
gameplay inputs, solver profile and floating-point environment. Scene RIDs are
local handles, not authoritative network entity identifiers. Removing the old
backends does not establish scene replication ordering or rollback.

## Verification

The pinned upstream MSVC Debug and Release suites passed locally, including
determinism, worker scheduling, recording and snapshot tests. The initial Debug
timeout is preserved; a retry used the same 120-second watchdog and passed.
The native port compiled all 25 C++ translation units against the engine APIs.
The initial cutover's native Windows editor passed twelve scene runs, including exact
300-tick one/four-worker trajectories and old-backend migration. Repeat those
checks for each newly qualified executable. Current combined-engine source,
binary identities, expanded scene results and Debug/Release export receipts are
recorded in [the integration checklist](https://github.com/ZSG-Studios/EGP/blob/e27546b81eb733de41caf891d09dfa2d361391d6/doc/egp_integration_loop.md):

```powershell
python misc/scripts/validate_box2d_scene.py --engine <editor.exe> --output .build/box2d-scene-cutover
python misc/scripts/validate_box3d_scene.py --engine <editor.exe> --output .build/box3d-scene-cutover
```

Scene fixtures cover sole backend registration, exact twin-world trajectories,
contacts and impulses, body replacement, query/motion exclusions, shared-shape
lifetimes, deletion during area callbacks, character floors and fixed-world
joint anchors. Each process has a 60-second watchdog; the trajectory fixture
also runs with four workers. Receipts identify the executable and fixture hashes.
Additional fixtures cover compound shape collision, rigid-body contacts, area
replacement, custom integrators and migration of old backend selections.
A relocated Windows debug template also passes a 90-tick probe of ordinary
2D/3D rigid bodies, default Box server classes and absence of legacy backends.
The matching native networking export passes fresh import, export, relocation,
five runtime fixtures and separate authenticated server/client processes.

## Remaining parity gates

The inherited adapter does not implement infinite world boundaries or separation
rays. Native contact tuning, speed bounds, sleep, continuous collision and warm
starting are exposed as space parameters; broader tuning behavior still requires
qualification. Ray CCD was removed; shape CCD remains supported. One-way rigid-body
penetration margins and moving-platform behavior need further qualification.
Convex solver polygons support at most eight vertices. Joint-space transfers,
full geometry/scaling semantics, network lifecycle ordering and scene rollback
also require work. Upstream solver serialization does not itself restore Godot
scene nodes or application state. Cross-platform and performance qualification
remain separate release gates. Current Windows Debug/Release packaged networking
and physics evidence covers the fixtures recorded in the integration checklist;
it does not establish scene rollback or other-platform coverage.

## Convex polygon input

`PhysicsServer2D.shape_set_data` accepts three to eight convex input points as
`PackedVector2Array`, or complete `(x, y, normal_x, normal_y)` tuples in
`PackedFloat32Array` (`PackedFloat64Array` for double-precision engines). Box2D
builds a convex hull and recomputes outward normals. Supplied normal values must
be finite. Input count is checked before writing bounded native storage; malformed
tuples, nonfinite values, transformed coordinates beyond native bounds, singular
transforms and invalid hulls report errors and produce no native query results.
The original data remains stored; attaching or querying it performs conversion.
Duplicate/interior points may be removed by the hull builder, and geometry below
the configured native tolerance is rejected without a fallback shape.

The focused fixtures compare transformed ray hits and shape-cast destinations for
three-, four- and eight-point vector/packed inputs. Negative fixtures exercise
count/tuple/type checks, nonfinite points/normals/transforms, native coordinate
bounds, collinear/tiny/singular geometry and successful queries after repair.
`validate_box2d_exports.py` includes these cases in relocated Debug/Release games.
Double-precision and broader polygon/scaling/platform qualification remain open.
